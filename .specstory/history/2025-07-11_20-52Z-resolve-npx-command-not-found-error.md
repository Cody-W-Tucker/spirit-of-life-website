_**Assistant**_

Looking at these error logs, I can see the main issue is that the system cannot find the `npx` command. The error `spawn npx ENOENT` indicates that `npx` is not available in your system's PATH.

Let me check what package manager you're using in this project and help you resolve this issue.


---

Read file: package.json

---

I can see that this project is using `pnpm` as the package manager (as indicated by `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.3"`). The issue is that your MCP configuration is trying to use `npx`, but since you're using `pnpm`, you should use `pnpm dlx` instead, which is pnpm's equivalent of `npx`.

Let me fix the MCP configuration:


---

<details><summary>Edit file: .cursor/mcp.json</summary>

I will change the command from "npx" to "pnpm" and update the args to use "dlx" instead of "-y"

</details>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the MCP configuration. The issues you were seeing were:

1. **Main Issue**: The system couldn't find `npx` because your project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. The error `spawn npx ENOENT` means "npx not found".

2. **Secondary Issue**: Because the Sanity MCP server couldn't start, you were getting "No server info found" errors when trying to list offerings.

**What I changed:**
- Changed `"command": "npx"` to `"command": "pnpm"`
- Changed `"args": ["-y", "@sanity/mcp-server@latest"]` to `"args": ["dlx", "@sanity/mcp-server@latest"]`

The `pnpm dlx` command is pnpm's equivalent of `npx` - it downloads and executes packages without installing them globally.

Now your Sanity MCP server should be able to start properly. You may need to restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.

I'm on nixos:

_**Assistant**_

Ah, that explains it! On NixOS, `pnpm` isn't available in the default PATH. Let me check if you have Node.js and npm available, and then we can use `npm` instead, or we need to ensure `pnpm` is properly available in your environment.

I see the issue! On NixOS, neither `node`, `npm`, nor `pnpm` are available in your PATH. This is typical for NixOS where packages need to be explicitly added to your environment.

Let me check if you have a `flake.nix` file that might be managing your development environment:


---

Read file: flake.nix

---

Perfect! You have a Nix flake that provides Node.js and pnpm. The issue is that you need to enter the development shell that this flake provides. Let me check if you're currently in the dev shell:


---

```bash
echo $IN_NIX_SHELL
```

```
❯ echo $IN_NIX_SHELL


spirit-of-life-website on  main [!] via 

```

---

You're not currently in the Nix development shell. You need to enter it to have access to Node.js and pnpm. Let me start the development shell:


---

```bash
nix develop
```

```
❯ nix develop

We could just use a nix-shell command:

_**Assistant**_

Exactly! You're right - we can use `nix-shell` to ensure the command runs in the proper environment with Node.js and pnpm available. Let me update the MCP configuration to use `nix-shell`:

Perfect! Now the MCP configuration will:

1. Use `nix-shell` to enter the development environment defined in your `flake.nix`
2. Run `pnpm dlx @sanity/mcp-server@latest` within that environment where Node.js and pnpm are available

This should resolve the `spawn pnpm ENOENT` error because `nix-shell` will provide the proper environment with all the necessary tools available.

You may need to restart Cursor for the changes to take effect. The Sanity MCP server should now be able to start properly!

_**User (2025-07-14 19:41Z)**_

Can't we just use npx



---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! Since we're using `nix-shell` to provide the environment, we can just use `npx` directly. The `nix-shell` will ensure Node.js and npm are available, so `npx` should work fine. Let me update the configuration:

Perfect! Now the configuration uses `nix-shell` to provide the Node.js environment and then runs `npx @sanity/mcp-server@latest` within that environment. This should work much better since:

1. `nix-shell` provides Node.js and npm (which includes npx)
2. `npx` is the standard way to run packages without installing them globally
3. It's simpler and more reliable than trying to use pnpm in this context

This should resolve the MCP server startup issues. You may need to restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.

_**User (2025-07-14 19:41Z)**_

Why does it try to spawn this in my home dir? I thought it was a workspace only mcp server

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right to question this! The MCP server should be running in the context of your workspace, not your home directory. The issue is that `nix-shell` by default runs in the current working directory, but Cursor might be spawning it from a different location.

Let me check the current MCP configuration and see if we can make it more explicit about the working directory:


---

Read file: .cursor/mcp.json

---

You're right - the MCP server should be workspace-specific. The issue might be that Cursor is spawning the process from your home directory instead of the workspace directory. Let me try a different approach by using an absolute path to the workspace and making the nix-shell command more explicit:


---

<details><summary>Edit file: .cursor/mcp.json</summary>

I will modify the command to explicitly set the working directory to the workspace and use a more explicit nix-shell command

3. Then runs `nix-shell` in that directory to ensure it finds the `flake.nix` file
4. Finally runs `npx @sanity/mcp-server@latest` within the nix-shell environment

This should ensure that:
- The MCP server runs in the correct workspace directory
- It has access to the `flake.nix` file for the proper development environment

This doesn't look right

_**Assistant**_

You're right, that doesn't look right. The process is starting but immediately closing without any error message, which suggests there might be an issue with the command execution. Let me try a simpler approach and test it first:

This should work correctly because:
- `nix develop` will enter the development shell from your `flake.nix`
- The `--command` flag tells it to run the specified command (`npx @sanity/mcp-server@latest`) within that environment
- Since your flake includes `nodePackages.pnpm`, it should also have `nodejs` and `npx` available
