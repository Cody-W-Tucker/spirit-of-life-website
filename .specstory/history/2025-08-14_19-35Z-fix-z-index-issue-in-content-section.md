# Fix z index issue in content section (2025-08-14 19:35Z)

_**User (2025-08-14 19:35Z)**_

@content-section.tsx Fix content section, there's a z index issue with headline and background graphics

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the z-index issue in the content section component. Let me first examine the current code to understand the problem and then implement a solution.

---

Read file: undefined

---

Now I can see the z-index issue. The problem is that the images have negative margins (`-mt-8 lg:-mt-40`) and may be overlapping with the header content, but there's no proper z-index stacking context established. Let me fix this by adding appropriate z-index values to ensure the headline and content stay above the background graphics:

Perfect! I've fixed the z-index issue in the content section component. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added `relative` positioning** to the main container to establish a stacking context
2. **Header section gets `z-20`** - This ensures the eyebrow badge and title always stay on top
3. **Content section gets `z-10`** - The rich text content stays above the images but below the header
4. **Image grid gets `z-0`** - The background graphics/images stay at the bottom layer
5. **Added proper positioning classes** (`relative`) to all elements that need z-index control

## Z-Index Hierarchy:
- **z-20**: Header (eyebrow badge and title)
- **z-10**: Rich text content 
- **z-0**: Background images/graphics

This creates a proper stacking order where:
- The headline and eyebrow badge are always visible on top
- The content text stays readable above any background graphics
- The images with negative margins (`-mt-8 lg:-mt-40`) now properly stay behind the content instead of overlapping

The fix ensures that even when images have negative margins that cause them to move upward, they won't interfere with the readability of the headlines and content text.

## Todo List

- [x] Add subtitle field to content-section.ts schema
- [x] Render subtitle in content-section.tsx component

---

Perfect! I've successfully added the subtitle field to both the schema and frontend component. Here's what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

### 1. Schema Update (`content-section.ts`)
- Added a new `subtitle` field after the title field
- Made it optional with a descriptive help text
- Field type is `string` for simple text input

### 2. Frontend Component Update (`content-section.tsx`)
- Added `subtitle` to the component props destructuring
- Rendered the subtitle below the title with appropriate styling:
  - `mt-6` for spacing from the title
  - `text-xl` for larger, readable text size
  - `text-muted-foreground` for subtle contrast (following the design system)
  - `max-w-3xl` to maintain good line length for readability

## Typography Hierarchy:
1. **Eyebrow Badge** - Small secondary text above title
2. **Title** - Large heading (`heading-2` class)
3. **Subtitle** - Medium text (`text-xl`) with muted color
4. **Rich Text Content** - Body content below

The subtitle styling follows the design system guidelines from your cursor rules, using muted foreground colors and appropriate spacing. It will only render if a subtitle is provided, maintaining clean layouts when not needed.

The z-index fix from earlier ensures all header elements (eyebrow, title, and subtitle) stay properly above any background graphics.

_**User (2025-08-14 19:35Z)**_

Did you see there was a linter error? We also need to add subtitle to @query.ts 

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! I need to check for linter errors and update the query to include the subtitle field. Let me fix both issues.

Now let me update the query to include the subtitle field in the contentSectionBlock:

---

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

---

I see the issue - I need to actually add the subtitle field to the query. Let me fix that:

## Todo List

- [x] Render subtitle in content-section.tsx component
- [x] Add subtitle field to Sanity query and regenerate types

---

Perfect! All issues have been resolved. Here's a summary of what I fixed:

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. **Schema Update** (`content-section.ts`)
- Added `subtitle` field to the content section schema
- Made it optional with helpful description text

### 2. **Frontend Component** (`content-section.tsx`)
- Added `subtitle` to component props
- Rendered subtitle with proper styling:
  - `mt-6` for spacing from title
  - `text-xl` for appropriate size
  - `text-muted-foreground` for design system consistency
  - `max-w-3xl` for optimal readability

### 3. **Query Update** (`query.ts`)
- Added `subtitle` field to the `contentSectionBlock` GROQ query
- Ensures the data is fetched from Sanity

### 4. **Type Generation**
- Ran `pnpm run type` in the studio to regenerate TypeScript types
- Fixed the linter error that was preventing TypeScript from recognizing the new subtitle field

## Result
The content section now supports an optional subtitle that appears between the main title and rich text content, following the design system's typography hierarchy and maintaining proper z-index stacking with the background graphics.

## Todo List

- [x] Fix fullpage-image component to handle missing links gracefully
- [x] Add colored bar overlay on top of the image

---

Let me check for any linter errors:

---

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the fullpage-image component. Here's what I implemented:

## ✅ Changes Made:

### 1. **Fixed Button Rendering Logic**
- **Before**: Button was rendered even without a valid `href`, showing "Link Broken"
- **After**: Only render button if `button?.href` exists
- **Logic**: `const validButton = button?.href ? { ...button, _key: button._key || reactId } : null`

### 2. **Added Colored Bar Overlay**
- Added a brand-colored bar at the top of the image
- **Styling**: `absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-2 bg-brand-primary z-20`
- **Color**: Uses `bg-brand-primary` (your heritage forest green #224A3F)
- **Position**: Top of the image with high z-index (z-20) to ensure it's visible

### 3. **Improved Z-Index Stacking**
- **z-0**: Background image
- **z-5**: Dark overlay for text readability
- **z-10**: Text and button content
- **z-20**: Brand color bar on top

### 4. **Enhanced Code Organization**
- Added clear comments for each section
- Separated the button validation logic for better readability
- Maintained existing functionality while fixing the broken link issue

## Key Benefits:

1. **No More "Link Broken" Buttons**: Component gracefully handles missing or invalid links
2. **Brand Consistency**: Added the brand color bar using your heritage green
3. **Visual Enhancement**: The colored bar adds a distinctive design element
4. **Proper Stacking**: All elements have correct z-index values for proper layering
5. **Accessibility**: Maintained aria-hidden attributes for decorative elements

The component now works seamlessly whether there's a button with a valid link, no button at all, or a button with missing href data. The brand-colored bar provides a consistent visual element that reinforces your church's identity on every fullpage image.

I'll remove the validation requirement from the fullpage-image schema to make the image field optional.

```

</details>

---

Perfect! I've removed the validation requirement from the image field in the fullpage-image schema. 

## ✅ Change Made:

**Removed Required Validation**: The image field is now optional instead of required, which provides more flexibility when creating fullpage image blocks.

**Before**: `validation: (Rule) => Rule.required()`
**After**: No validation (making it optional)

This change allows content creators to:
- Create fullpage image blocks with just overlay text and/or buttons
- Use the component as a text-only hero section with the brand color bar
- Add images later without being forced to include one initially

Since you've also made the frontend component handle missing images gracefully (with the `{image && ...}` conditional), this change makes the schema consistent with the component's flexible behavior.

The schema now supports all these use cases:
1. **Full setup**: Image + overlay text + button
2. **Image + text only**: Image + overlay text (no button)
3. **Text only**: Just overlay text (no image, no button)
4. **Minimal**: Just the brand color bar (no image, no text, no button)
