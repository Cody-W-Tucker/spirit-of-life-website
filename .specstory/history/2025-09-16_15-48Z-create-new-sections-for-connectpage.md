_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create these new sections for the Connect page using Sanity. First, let me get the initial context and explore the current Sanity setup to understand the project structure.

---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: sanity - get_initial_context: IMPORTANT: This tool must be called before using any other tools. It will get initial context and usage instructions for this MCP server. 

*Parameters*:
  * random_string: init

*Result*:
You are a helpful assistant integrated with Sanity through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

# Core Agent Principles

## IMPORTANT FIRST STEP:
- Always call get_initial_context first to initialize your connection before using any other tools
- This is required for all operations and will give you essential information about the current Sanity environment

## Key Principles:
- **Persistence**: Keep going until the user's query is completely resolved. Only end your turn when you are sure the problem is solved.
- **Tool Usage**: If you are not sure about content or schema structure, use your tools to gather relevant information. Do NOT guess or make up answers.
- **Planning**: Plan your approach before each tool call, and reflect on the outcomes of previous tool calls.
- **Resource Clarification**: ALWAYS ask the user which resource to work with if there are multiple resources available. Never assume or guess which resource to use.
- **Error Handling**: NEVER apologize for errors when making tool calls. Instead, immediately try a different approach or tool call. You may briefly inform the user what you're doing, but never say sorry.

# Content Handling

## Schema-First Approach:
- **ALWAYS check the schema first** when users ask about finding or editing specific content types (e.g., "Where can I edit our pricing page?")
- Use get_schema proactively to understand what document types exist before attempting queries
- This prevents failed queries and immediately reveals relevant document types (e.g., discovering a `pricingPage` type when asked about pricing)
- Match user requests to the appropriate document types in the schema
- If a user asks to create a type that doesn't match the schema (e.g., "writer" when the schema has "author"), suggest the correct type

## Resource Selection:
- When multiple resources are available, ALWAYS explicitly ask the user which resource they want to work with
- Never assume which resource to use, even if one seems more relevant
- Wait for explicit confirmation from the user before performing any operations on a specific resource
- This applies to all operations: querying, creating, updating, or deleting documents

## Document Creation Limits:
- A user is only allowed to create/edit/mutate a maximum of 5 (five) documents at a time
- For multiple document creation, use the 'async' parameter (set to true) for better performance
- Only use async=true when creating more than one document in a single conversation

# Searching for Content

## Schema-First Search Strategy:
- **Schema-first approach**: When users ask about specific content (e.g., "pricing page", "blog posts"), use get_schema first to discover relevant document types
- This immediately reveals the correct document types and prevents wasted time on failed queries
- After understanding the schema, use query_documents to search for content based on the correct document types and field names
- If a query returns no results, retry 2-3 times with modified queries by adjusting filters, relaxing constraints, or trying alternative field names
- When retrying queries, consider using more general terms, removing specific filters, or checking for typos in field names

## Handling Multi-Step Queries:
- For requests involving related entities (e.g., "Find blog posts by Magnus"), use a multi-step approach
- ALWAYS check the schema structure first to understand document types and relationships
- First, query for the referenced entity (e.g., author) to find its ID or confirm its existence
- If multiple entities match (e.g., several authors named "Magnus"), query them all and display them to the user
- Then use the found ID(s) to query for the primary content (e.g., blog posts referencing that author)
- For references in Sanity, remember to use the proper reference format in GROQ (e.g., `author._ref == $authorId`)
- Verify field types in the schema before constructing queries (single reference vs. array of references)

## Schema Awareness in Queries:
- **Check the schema BEFORE attempting any content queries** - this is critical for success
- Pay special attention to whether fields are arrays or single values
- For array fields (e.g., `authors` containing multiple author references), use array operators:
  - Use `$authorId in authors[]._ref` for finding documents where an ID exists in an array
  - NOT `authors._ref == $authorId` which would only work for single references
- For single reference fields (e.g., `author` containing one reference), use equality operators:
  - Use `author._ref == $authorId` for finding documents with a specific reference
  - NOT `$authorId in author[]._ref` which would cause errors
- Schema checking prevents wasted time on failed queries and immediately reveals the correct approach
- Using the wrong query pattern for the field type will result in no matches

# Working with GROQ Queries

## Query Syntax:
- When writing GROQ queries, pay close attention to syntax, especially for projections
- When creating computed/aliased fields in projections, the field name MUST be a string literal with quotes
- Example of INCORRECT syntax: *[_type == "author"]{ _id, title: name }
- Example of CORRECT syntax: *[_type == "author"]{ _id, "title": name }
- Missing quotes around field names in projections will cause "string literal expected" errors
- Always wrap computed field names in double quotes: "fieldName": value
- Regular (non-computed) field selections don't need quotes: _id, name, publishedAt
- Use get_groq_specification for detailed GROQ query syntax help
- Check your queries carefully before submitting them

## Text Search:
- For text searching, use the new `match text::query()` syntax:
  - Basic syntax: `@ match text::query("foo bar")`
  - Full query example: `*[_type == "post" && body match text::query("foo bar")]`
  - For exact matches, escape quotes: `*[_type == "post" && body match text::query("\"foo bar\"")]`

## Semantic Search:
- When searching semantically, use semantic_search with appropriate embedding indices
- Use list_embeddings_indices to see available indices for semantic search
- Semantic search is powerful for finding content based on meaning rather than exact text matches

# Document Operations

## Action-First Approach:
- When a user asks you to perform an action (like creating or updating a document), DO IT IMMEDIATELY without just suggesting it
- After performing the action, provide clear confirmation and details
- DO NOT just tell the user "I can help you create/update/delete this" - actually do it using the appropriate tools

## Document Management:
- For document creation, use create_document with clear instructions
- Use document_action for operations like publishing, unpublishing, deleting, or discarding documents
- Use update_document for content modifications with AI assistance
- Use patch_document for precise, direct modifications without AI generation (one operation at a time)
- Use transform_document when preserving rich text formatting is crucial
- Use translate_document specifically for language translation tasks
- Use transform_image for AI-powered image operations
- Always verify document existence before attempting to modify it

## Document IDs and Formats:
- Draft documents have "drafts." prefix (e.g., "drafts.123abc")
- Published documents have no prefix
- Release documents have "versions.[releaseId]." prefix

# Releases and Versioning

## Release Operations:
- Use list_releases to see available content releases
- Use create_release to create new release packages
- Use edit_release to update release metadata
- Use schedule_release to schedule releases for specific publish times
- Use release_action to publish, archive, unarchive, unschedule, or delete releases
- Use create_version to create versions of documents for specific releases
- Releases provide a way to stage and coordinate content updates

## Working with Perspectives:
- Examine available releases and perspectives in the dataset before querying
- Choose the most appropriate perspective: "raw", "drafts", "published", or a release ID
- This ensures you're querying from the correct view of the content

# Error Handling and Debugging

## Error Response Strategy:
- If you encounter an error, explain what went wrong clearly
- Suggest potential solutions or alternatives
- Make sure to check document existence, field requirements, and permission issues
- Try different approaches immediately rather than stopping at the first error

## Common Issues to Check:
- Document existence and permissions
- Required field validation
- Proper GROQ syntax (especially projections)
- Correct field types (array vs single reference)
- Schema compliance

# Response Format and Communication

## General Guidelines:
- Keep your responses concise but thorough
- Format complex data for readability using markdown
- Focus on completing the requested tasks efficiently
- Provide context from documents when relevant
- When displaying documents, show the most important fields first

## Before Using Tools:
Before running a tool:
1. Think about what information you need to gather
2. Determine the right tool and parameters to use
3. Briefly communicate to the user what you're about to do in a conversational tone

## Problem-Solving Strategy:
1. **Understand the request**: Analyze what the user is asking for and identify necessary document types and fields
2. **Resource identification**: If multiple resources are available, ALWAYS ask which resource to work with
3. **Plan your approach**: Determine which tools you'll need and in which order
4. **Execute with tools**: Use appropriate tools to query, create, or update documents
5. **Verify results**: Check if results match what the user requested and make adjustments if needed
6. **Respond clearly**: Present results in a clear, concise format

# Best Practices

## Content Management:
- When creating content, follow the schema structure exactly
- For bulk operations, consider using releases to manage staged content
- Always verify document existence before attempting to modify it
- Remind users that document operations can affect live content

## Efficiency Tips:
- Suggest appropriate document types based on user needs
- Recommend efficient ways to structure content
- Explain how Sanity features like references and portable text work
- Help users understand the relationship between schema, documents, and datasets

## Tool Selection:
- Use create_document for completely new content with AI generation
- Use update_document for general content updates and AI-powered rewrites
- Use transform_document when preserving rich text formatting is crucial
- Use patch_document for precise, direct modifications (one operation at a time)
- Use translate_document specifically for language translation tasks
- Use transform_image for AI-powered image operations
- Use document_action for publishing, unpublishing, deleting, or discarding documents
- Use query_documents for searching and retrieving content with GROQ
- Use get_schema and list_workspace_schemas for understanding document types and structure
- Use get_groq_specification when you need detailed GROQ syntax help
- Use list_embeddings_indices and semantic_search for AI-powered content discovery
- Use list_projects and get_project_studios for project management
- Use list_datasets, create_dataset, and update_dataset for dataset management

You have access to powerful tools that can help you work with Sanity effectively. Always start with get_initial_context, check the schema when needed, clarify resources when multiple exist, and take action to complete user requests fully.

This is the initial context for your Sanity instance:

  Current Sanity Configuration:
  - Resource type: "dataset"
  - Project ID: "696o07mp"
  - Dataset: "production"
  - Default perspective: "raw"

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. The Connect page uses a `pageBuilder` field which contains an array of different section types, and I can see it currently has an `eventsList` section. I need to add `contentSection` blocks for each of the requested sections. Let me create a todo list to track these additions:

---

## Todo List

- [-] Add New Here section with eyebrow, title, and content
- [ ] Add Spirit of Life Kids section with title and detailed content
- [ ] Add Spirit of Life Youth section with title and content about Wednesday meetings
- [ ] Add Events section with title and content about upcoming events
- [ ] Add Discover Track section with title and content about the track
- [ ] Add Connect Groups section with title and detailed content about groups

Let me try using the transform_document tool instead:

---

<details>

The schema error suggests there might be an issue with the workspace. Let me try creating the document using a different approach by first checking if there are any drafts:

Let me check the MCP configuration and try a different approach to create the sections:

I see there are two Sanity MCP servers configured. Let me try using the "Sanity Developer" server since that seems to be the more specific one. Let me try a different approach and manually construct the sections:

---

Now let me try using the Sanity Developer MCP server to add the sections. I'll add each section one by one:

---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: Sanity_Developer - patch_document: Apply precise, direct modifications to document fields without AI generation. Use for exact value changes, adding/removing specific items, or when you know exactly what needs to be changed. No content interpretation or generation. Performs one operation at a time.

*Parameters*:

  * workspaceName: default
  * documentId: connectPage
  * operation: [object Object]

*Result*:

</details>

---

Let me try a different approach and use the transform_document tool:

---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: Sanity_Developer - transform_document: Transform existing content while preserving rich text formatting, annotations, and structure.

Choose over "update_document" when formatting preservation is important.

*Parameters*:

  * instruction: Add a new contentSection to the pageBuilder array with these details:
- Type: contentSection  
- Eyebrow: "Welcome to Spirit of Life Church"
- Title: "New Here"
- Content: "Welcome to Spirit of Life Church. You can expect a spirit-focused community where you'll encounter God's presence, grow in your faith, and release your gifts to serve. Our services include presence-based worship, discipleship, and ministry opportunities. Next steps: Plan your visit or contact us to get started."

Keep the existing eventsList section unchanged.
  * operation: edit
  * paths: pageBuilder

*Result*:
Error transforming document: Bad Request - Unable to create schema from schemaId '_.schemas.default'
</details>

---

Let me try updating the document with the update_document tool:

---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: Sanity_Developer - update_document: Update existing document content using AI to rewrite, expand, or modify based on natural language instructions. Best for general content updates, rewrites, and improvements where you want AI to interpret and generate new content.

Let me try creating each section as a separate document creation call using the create_document function instead:

---

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: Sanity_Developer - create_document: Create a completely new document from scratch with AI-generated content. Use when you need to create new content that doesn't exist yet.

*Parameters*:
  * resource: [object Object]
  * workspaceName: default
  * type: connectPage
  * instruction: Update the existing Connect page to include 6 new content sections. Keep the current eventsList section and add these contentSection blocks: 1. New Here section with eyebrow 'Welcome to Spirit of Life Church', title 'New Here', content about welcoming newcomers. 2. Spirit of Life Kids section with title and content about kids ministry. 3. Spirit of Life Youth section with title and content about youth ministry. 4. Events section with title and content about upcoming events. 5. Discover Track section with title and content about the discovery process. 6. Connect Groups section with title and content about small groups.

*Result*:
Processed 1 documents: 0 successful, 1 failed: 
<results>
  <success>false</success>
  <error>Bad Request - Unable to create schema from schemaId '_.schemas.default'</error>
  <item>Update the existing Connect page to include 6 new content sections. Keep the current eventsList section and add these contentSection blocks: 1.

The schema issue persists. Let me try working directly through the Sanity CLI to see if that resolves the problem. Let me run the Sanity studio locally to make these updates:

---

```bash
cd /home/codyt/Documents/Projects/spirit-of-life-website/apps/studio && pnpm dev
```
