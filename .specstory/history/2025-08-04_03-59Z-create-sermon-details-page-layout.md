# Create sermon details page layout (2025-08-04 03:59Z)

_**User (2025-08-04 15:39Z)**_

Let's create a simple sermon details page in @/app so we can see what it would look like, follow the style guide, but we can use placeholder content. It should have a youtube iframe and then a body of contents

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a sermon details page that follows the existing style guide and includes a YouTube iframe with placeholder content. Let me first examine the current structure and styling patterns.


---

Read file: apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx

---

Read file: apps/web/src/app/page.tsx

---

Read file: apps/web/src/components/sections/hero.tsx

---

Read file: apps/web/src/components/sections/content-section.tsx

---

Now let me check the existing blog and event pages to understand the pattern for detail pages:


---

Read file: apps/web/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

---

Now let me check the global styles to understand the heading classes:


---

Read file: packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css

---

Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the design system. Let me create a sermon details page that follows the established patterns. I'll create it in the `apps/web/src/app/sermons/[slug]` directory:

I'm creating a new sermon details page that follows the existing design patterns with a YouTube iframe and rich content body

+                     Faith is not just a concept we read about in the Bible—it's a living, breathing reality that transforms how we see the world and make decisions. In today's message, we'll explore what it means to truly walk in faith and trust God's plan for our lives.

+                     Hebrews 11:1 tells us that 'faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.' This definition challenges us to look beyond our immediate circumstances and trust in God's greater plan.

+                   <p>
+                     Throughout Scripture, we see countless examples of men and women who walked in faith despite overwhelming odds. Abraham left his homeland without knowing where he was going. Moses led the Israelites through the Red Sea. David faced Goliath with nothing but a sling and his trust in God.

Perfect! Now let me test the page by running the development server to see how it looks:


---

```bash
cd /home/codyt/Documents/Projects/spirit-of-life-website && pnpm dev
```

---

Great! I've successfully created a sermon details page that follows the existing design system. Here's what I've implemented:

## Sermon Details Page Features

### **Design System Compliance**
- ✅ Uses the established heading classes (`heading-1`, `heading-3`, `heading-4`, `heading-5`)
- ✅ Follows the brand color scheme with proper Tailwind theme colors
- ✅ Uses consistent spacing patterns (`section-spacing`, `mb-8`, etc.)
- ✅ Implements the component-based architecture

### **Page Structure**
1. **Hero Section** - Clean header with sermon metadata
   - Series badge
   - Main title using `heading-1`
   - Speaker, date, and duration with icons
   - Description paragraph

2. **Video Player** - YouTube iframe integration
   - Responsive aspect-video container
   - Proper iframe attributes for accessibility
   - Rounded corners and shadow for visual appeal

3. **Content Section** - Sermon notes with proper typography
   - Structured content with headings and paragraphs
   - Uses the established prose classes
   - Clear section organization

4. **Call-to-Action** - Engagement elements
   - Muted background card
   - Action buttons for small groups and downloads
   - Follows the brand's engagement patterns

5. **Sidebar** - Navigation and related content
   - Sticky table of contents with anchor links
   - Related sermons section
   - Consistent with existing blog/event patterns

### **Key Design Elements**
- **Typography**: Uses the established heading hierarchy and font weights
- **Colors**: Leverages the brand's green palette and muted backgrounds
- **Spacing**: Follows the defined spacing scale (`section-spacing`, `mb-8`, etc.)
- **Components**: Uses existing UI components (Badge, Button) consistently
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with proper breakpoints

### **Placeholder Content**
The page includes realistic placeholder content about "Walking in Faith" with:
- YouTube video embed (using a placeholder ID)
- Structured sermon notes with biblical references
- Related sermons in the sidebar
- Call-to-action for engagement

The page is now ready to view at `/sermons/[slug]` and demonstrates how sermon content would be presented following the established design patterns. The layout is clean, professional, and maintains the church's brand identity while providing an excellent user experience for consuming sermon content.
