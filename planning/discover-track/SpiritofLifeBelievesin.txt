SPIRIT OF LIFE CHURCH BELIEVES IN...

LIVING THE MISSION: Developing fully transformed
followers of Jesus Christ.
Presence Based

Almighty.”

The Great Commandment
“Jesus replied, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the ﬁrst and
greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these
two commandments."
Matthew 22:37-40 NIV

The Great Commission
"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have
commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the
very end of the age.”
Matthew 28:19-20 NIV
