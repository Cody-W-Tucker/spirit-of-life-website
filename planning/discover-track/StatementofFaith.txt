STATEMENT OF FAITH

Holy Bible
The Holy Bible, and only the Bible, is the authoritative Word of
God. It alone is the ﬁnal authority in determining all doctrinal
truths. In its original writing, it is inspired, infallible, and inerrant.
(2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Proverbs 30:5; Romans 16:25-26)

Trinity
There is one God, maker of all things who eternally exists in the
Trinity as three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These three
are co-equal and co-eternal (1 John 5:4-7; John 1:1-14)

Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ is God the Son, the second person of the Trinity. On
earth, Jesus was 100% God and 100% man. He is the only man
ever to have lived a sinless life. He was born of a virgin,
performed miracles, died on the cross for mankind, and thus
atoned for our sins through the shedding of His blood. He rose
from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures,
ascended to the right hand of the Father, and will return again in
power and glory. (John 1:1, 14, 20:28; 1 Timothy 3:16; Isaiah 9:6;
Philippians 2:5-6; 1 Timothy 2:5)

Virgin Birth
Jesus Christ was conceived by God the Father, through the Holy
Spirit (the third person of the Trinity) in the virgin Mary’s womb;
therefore, He is the Son of God. (Matthew 1:18, 25; Luke 1:35; Isaiah
7:14; Luke 1:27-35)

Redemption
Man was created good and upright, but by voluntary
transgression he fell. His only hope of redemption is in Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. Christ is the Lamb of God and His shed
blood is the only atonement for our sin. We are saved by God’s
grace through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ
through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit. (Genesis 1:26-31, 3:1-7;
Romans 5:12-21; John 3:3, 16; Colossians 4:4-7; Ephesians 2:8-9)

Regeneration
For anyone to know God, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is
absolutely essential. (John 6:44, 65; Matthew 19:28; Titus 3:5)

Salvation
We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ: His death,
burial, and resurrection. Salvation is a gift from God, not a result
of our good works or of any human efforts. (Ephesians 2:8-9;
Galatians 2:16, 3:8; Titus 3:5; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31; Hebrews 9:22)

Repentance
Repentance is the commitment to turn away from sin in every
area of our lives and to follow Christ, which allows us to receive
His redemption and to be regenerated by the Holy Spirit. Thus,
through repentance we receive forgiveness of sins and
appropriate salvation. (Acts 2:21, 3:19; 1 John 1:9)

Sanctiﬁcation
Sanctiﬁcation is the ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word
and His Spirit in order to complete the development of Christ’s
character in us. It is through the present ministry of the Holy
Spirit and the Word of God that the Christian is enabled to live a
Godly life. (1 Thessalonians 4:3, 5:23; 2 Corinthians 3:18, 6:14-18,
2 Thessalonians 2:1-3, Romans 8:29, 12:1-2, Hebrews 2:11)

Jesus’ Blood
The Blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was
sinless and is 100% sufficient to cleanse mankind of all sin. Jesus
allowed Himself to be punished for both our sinfulness and our
sins, enabling all those who believe to be free from the penalty of
sin, which is death. (1 John 1:7; Revelation 1:5, 5:9; Colossians 1:20;
Romans 3:10-12, 23, 5:9; John 1:29)

The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit dwells in the believer from the moment of the
new birth. The Holy Spirit draws the believer closer to God,
imparting spiritual gifts and empowering ministry. The inﬁlling of
the Holy Spirit is essential for the spirit-ﬁlled life, for operating in
His giftings, and bearing His fruit. (John 14:26, 15:26; Acts 1:8;
Mark 16:15-20; 1 Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:16-25)

Baptism in the Holy Spirit
The baptism in the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost. It is the
promise of the Father, sent by Jesus after His Ascension, to
empower the Church to preach the Gospel throughout the whole
earth. It is available to every believer to empower an individual
to display the reality of Jesus Christ. Also, it helps to lead the
believer into victorious living and to continually equip them for
practical, effective, spirit-ﬁlled ministry and service. (Acts 1:5, 1:8;
Ephesians 5:18) The spirit ﬁlled life is amazingly empowering, not
limited to a one-time experience. (Joel 2:28-29; Matthew 3:11; Mark
16:17; Acts 1:5, 2:1-4, 17, 38-39, 8:14-17, 10:38, 44-47, 11:15-17, 19:1-6)

The Gifts of the Holy Spirit
The gifts of the Spirit operate today in all believers. We believe
that the gifts of the Holy Spirit have not passed away, but are
still in operation today. Believers need these gifts to help others
and impact the world for Jesus Christ just as in the ﬁrst century.
The Holy Spirit is manifested through a variety of spiritual gifts
to build and sanctify the church, demonstrate the validity of the
resurrection, and conﬁrm the power of the Gospel. The Bible’s
lists of these gifts are not necessarily exhaustive, and the gifts
may occur in various combinations. All believers are commanded
to earnestly desire the manifestation of the gifts in their lives.
These gifts always operate in harmony with the Scriptures and
should never be used in violation of Biblical parameters. (Hebrews
2:4; Romans 1:11, 12 :4-8; Ephesians 4:16; 1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:6-7;
1 Corinthians 12:1-31, 14:1-40; 1 Peter 4:10)

The Church
The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through
the Spirit, with divine appointments for the fulﬁllment of Jesus’
Great Commission. Every person who is born of the Spirit is an
integral part of the Church as a member of the body of believers.
There is a spiritual unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.
(Ephesians 1:22, 2:19-22; Hebrews 12:23; John 17:11, 20-23)

Marriage
Marriage is deﬁned in the Bible as a covenant established by
God, a sacred bond between one man and one woman, instituted
by and publicly entered into before God. A believer should
pursue a marriage relationship with a person of the Christian
faith. God hates divorce and its effects, but loves the divorced
person and desires to restore and bless them. (Matthew 19:3-9;
1 Corinthians 7:27-28; 2 Corinthians 6:14-15)

Water Baptism
Water baptism is commanded by Jesus, following faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ, as a public declaration of the inward
transformation of the new birth. The new convert is baptized in
water in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Acts 2:38; 8:12, 36-38; 10:47-48
Mark 16:16) We are not saved through baptism, yet it
demonstrates that we have received a new life in Christ.

The Lord’s Supper
The Lord’s Supper is a celebration for all believers. It symbolizes
our participation in the new covenant that was sealed by Jesus’
sacriﬁcial death on the cross. The elements of bread and grape
juice are taken in remembrance of and a representative of the
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. God ministers to His people
through this special time of communion. (1 Corinthians 10:16;
11:23-28; Luke 22:14-22 Matthew 26:26-29)

Healing of the Sick
Healing of the sick is illustrated in the life and ministry of Jesus
and included in the commission of Jesus to His disciples. It is
given as a sign, which is to follow believers. It is also a part of
Jesus’ work on the cross and one of the gifts of the Spirit. (Psalm
103:2-3; Isaiah 53:5; Matthew 8:16-17; Mark 16:17-18; Acts 8:6-7;
James 5:14-16; 1 Corinthians 12:9, 28; Romans 11:29)

Intercession and Prayer
Intercession and prayer are essential and foundational to the
ministry of the church. (Matthew 6:9-13; 2 Corinthians 10:3-5;
Romans 8:26-28)

God’s Will for Provision
It is the Father’s will for believers to become whole, healthy, and
successful in all areas of life. Because of the fall, many may not
receive the full beneﬁts of God’s will while on Earth, but that fact
should never prevent all believers from seeking the full beneﬁts
of Christ’s provision in order to better serve others. Because it is
God’s heart to heal (Luke 5:12-13), we pray for and believe in
divine healing, even though there are times when people are not
healed. (I Peter 2:24; Mark 16:18; James 5:13-15)
• Spiritual
John 3:3-11; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21; Romans 10:9-10
• Mental and Emotional
2 Timothy 1:7, 2:11; Philippians 4:7-8; Romans 12:2; Isaiah 26:3
• Physical
Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:17; 1 Peter 2:24
• Financial
Joshua 1:8; Malachi 3:10-11; Luke 6:38; 2 Corinthians 9:6-10;
Deuteronomy 28:1-14; Psalm 34:10, 84:11; Philippians 4:19

Tithes and Offerings
Everything we have comes from the Father and the giving of
tithes and offerings are an expression of joy and thanksgiving for
His provision. The Biblical ﬁrst fruit, “tithe” (10%), reveals to us an
important principle of the power of the ﬁrst. We believe it is the
key to the blessed life. When given to God, it has incredible
impact on us personally and is the redemptive portion that
carries the power to redeem the rest. (Matthew 6:20-21, 23;
Luke 11:42)

The Great Commission
God commands all believers to carry the Good News of Jesus
Christ to all of the world and to make disciples (followers of
Jesus) of all peoples. Our mission is to reach Jerusalem (our
community), Judea (surrounding areas), Samaria (especially to
difficult areas), and to the ends of the world. (Matthew 28:18-20)

Resurrection
Jesus Christ was physically resurrected from the dead in a
gloriﬁed body three days after His death on the cross. Both the
saved and the lost will be resurrected. Those that are saved to
the resurrection of life and those that are lost to the resurrection
of eternal damnation. (Luke 24:16, 36, 39; John 2:19-21, 20:26-28, 21:4;
Acts 24:15; 1 Corinthians 15:42, 44; Philippians 1:21-23, 3:21)

Heaven
Heaven is the eternal dwelling place for all believers in the
Gospel of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 5:3, 12, 20, 6:20, 19:21, 25:34;
John 17:24; 2 Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 11:16; 1 Peter 1:4)

Hell
After living one life on earth, the unbelievers will be judged by
God and sent to Hell where they will be eternally tormented with
the Devil and the Fallen Angels. (Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:43-48;
Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 14:9-11, 20:12-15, 21:8)

Second Coming
Jesus Christ will physically and visibly return to earth for the
second time to establish His Kingdom. This will occur at a date
undisclosed by the Scriptures. Regardless of which position you
hold,
whether
it
is
pre-tribulation,
mid-tribulation,
post-tribulation, or some other position, we are certain of one
thing from the Bible: “He will come again in glory to judge the
living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.” At Spirit
of Life we work diligently at preparing ourselves for His return.
That preparation includes loving God with all our hearts, and
living our lives in a consecrated, purposeful way, while reaching
out to a lost and dying world. (Matthew 24:30, 26:63-64; Acts 1:9-11;
1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-8; Revelation 1:7)
