  Jonathan became the Lead Pastor at Spirit of Life in March 2015.  His passion is to help others encounter the presence of God, to help people discover their God given purpose, and to help equip and empower leaders.
  He came to Spirit of Life in July 2010 as the Leadership Pastor with the responsibilities of youth, college age, young adults, and co-leading School of the Spirit with his wife Becky.  His responsibility was to raise up emerging leaders in the local church.
  Jonathan and Becky transitioned to Nebraska from being staff pastors at a regional prayer missions base just north of Cedar Rapids, IA (Wind and Fire Ministries).   Jonathan and Becky met each other in 2007 towards the end of his time directing the Des Moines Masterâs Commission (a discipleship school based out of Eastwood Church of the Open Bible).
  Jonathan has a heart for seeking hard after the presence of God, and normalizing the supernatural and Kingdom principles in the life of the believer.
