Scripture Reading Plan
THE READ SCRIPTURE PLAN
This plan takes you through the entire bible in two years.   The scriptures are divided up into sixteen âchaptersâ and organized in semi-chronological order.   Youâll read two or three chapters a day, and sometimes skim through larger portions that contain genealogies, census information, etc.
Psalms of Prayer
One Psalm is listed every other day for you to slowly pray through, making its words your own.  By the end youâll have prayed through the book of Psalms 2.5 times.
VIDEOS
Each time you come to a new book of the Bible, there will be a short animated video on The Bible Project website about that bookâs design and message and what to look for as you read. You can also sign up to have those videos emailed to your inbox. In addition to videos regarding books of the Bible, you will find theme videos relating to several topics that appear throughout Scripture.
To watch the videosâ¦.Go to [thebibleproject.com](https://bibleproject.com/)â¦. Click Menu in the top right cornerâ¦.Click on Videos....Choose the category you'd like.  You'll have to search between Book Collections, New Testament Overviews, Old Testament Overviews, or Themed Videos to find the corresponding video for a certain day.  You may also download the âRead Scriptureâ app in your smart phoneâs app store.
