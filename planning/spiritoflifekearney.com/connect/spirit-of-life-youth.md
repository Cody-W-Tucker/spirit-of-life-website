![]()
Wednesdays
6:30 p.m. - 8 p.m.
6th - 12th grades
Our heart and desire is to take youth from where they are at right now to the deepest places God has for them.  In some cases, youth will start in the "shallow end" and take a journey to the "deep end".  In keeping with the vision and flow of the overall church, we have a desire for the presence of God to mark everything we do.  There are lots of fun activities and events that we participate in. There's an understanding that this age group needs an outlet for fun and excitement.  However, our main goal is to develop fully transformed followers of Jesus with a deep passion for the presence of God.
