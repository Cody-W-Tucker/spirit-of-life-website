# Spirit of Life Church Website Content Plan

## Design Inspirations
- **kearneygrace.com**: Menu structure and parallax scrolling effects
- **bethel.com**: Video integration and navigation style
- **centraliabbc.org**: Full-page hero slider content
- **Previous site**: Retain logo, color scheme, and media library organization

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice
- **Welcoming**: Text should be inviting and inclusive, speaking to both long-time members and first-time visitors
- **Authentic**: Content should feel genuine, transparent, and conversational, not corporate or overly formal
- **Spirit-focused**: Emphasize the spiritual aspects of church life and the presence of God
- **Inspiring**: Encourage action and engagement through empowering language
- **Clear**: Use straightforward language that avoids insider church terminology when possible

### Writing Style
- Use second person ("you") to directly address the reader
- Keep sentences concise but warm
- Balance between reverent and relatable language
- Incorporate Scripture references where appropriate, but don't overuse
- Use the "Encounter, Grow, Release" framework consistently to organize content
- Avoid unnecessary capitalization (capitalize titles and proper nouns only)

### Tone By Section
- **Home Page**: Inviting, concise, inspirational
- **About**: Storytelling, community-focused, transparent
- **Connect**: Practical, encouraging, actionable
- **Media**: Accessible, educational, resource-oriented

- **Contact**: Helpful, straightforward, responsive

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on benefits to the reader rather than just features or information

- **Family Based**: Building relationships that reflect God's desire for family

### Biblical Foundation
