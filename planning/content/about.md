- **Encounter** God in presence-based services
- **Grow** in intentional discipleship and deep friendships in presence-based groups
- **Release** presence-based ministry by showing up powerfully in our spheres of influence

## Our Story

Spirit of Life Church began with a clear prophetic word that resonates to this day: "I want you to be there for families" and "If you take care of My kids, I'll take care of your church."

From our humble beginnings to our present ministry, we have remained committed to creating a place where people of all backgrounds can encounter God's transforming presence, grow in authentic relationships, and discover their divine purpose.

## Our Mission & Beliefs

### Who We Are

**Spirit of Life Church is:**

- **Presence Based:** Connecting to God's presence is the key to experiencing His life. *"And he said, 'Please show me Your glory.' Then He said, 'I will make all My goodness pass before you...'"* (Exodus 33:18-19)

- **Grace Based:** Everything was won at Calvary. We don't fight for victory, but from His victory. *"But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter."* (Romans 7:6)

- **Identity Based:** Every person is over the top significant to God. Every person is God's idea. Every person displays a part of God's glory. *"For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."* (Colossians 3:3)

- **Supernatural Based:** Nothing is impossible. Unlimited resource is available from the kingdom of God. *"And saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.'"* (Mark 1:15)

- **Family Based:** Everything in God's kingdom flows in relationships. He created the entire universe because He wanted a family - sons and daughters. *"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named."* (Ephesians 3:14-15)

### What We Believe

At Spirit of Life Church, we believe in:

- **The Bible** as the inspired and authoritative Word of God
- **One God** who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- **Jesus Christ** as fully God and fully man, His virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, and bodily resurrection
- **Salvation** by grace through faith in Jesus Christ
- **The Holy Spirit** who dwells in believers and empowers Christian living
- **Spiritual gifts** that are active and available to all believers today
- **Divine healing** as part of Christ's redemptive work
- **The Church** as the Body of Christ and God's primary vehicle for ministry on earth
- **Water baptism** and communion as biblical practices for the church
- **The Great Commission** to make disciples of all nations

## Our Networks

Spirit of Life is proudly affiliated with Open Bible Churches, a dynamic movement of churches with roots reaching back to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in 1906 at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles.

Open Bible Churches originated from two revival movements: Bible Standard Conference (founded in Eugene, Oregon, in 1919) and Open Bible Evangelistic Association (founded in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1932). These groups united in 1935 as "Open Bible Standard Churches" with the national office in Des Moines.

Simple faith, emphasis on prayer, evangelism, international missions, and free fellowship with other groups continue to characterize this growing organization.
