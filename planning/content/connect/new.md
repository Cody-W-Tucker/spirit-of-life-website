# New to Spirit of Life?

## What to Expect on Sundays

### When You Arrive

When you pull into our parking lot, you'll be greeted by our friendly Parking Team who will help direct you to the main entrance. As you enter the building, our Host Team will welcome you and answer any questions you might have.

If you have children, our Host Team will direct you to our check-in station where our Spirit of Life Kids Team will help get your children registered for our age-appropriate programs.

### During the Service

Our services typically last about 90 minutes and include:

- **Contemporary Worship**: We believe in creating an atmosphere where people can encounter God's presence through music
- **Practical Bible Teaching**: Our messages are relevant, authentic, and rooted in Scripture
- **Prayer Ministry**: We set aside time to pray for needs and respond to what God is doing
- **Communion**: We regularly celebrate communion together as a church family

### After the Service

After the service, we invite you to stop by our Welcome Table in the foyer where we have a free gift for first-time guests. Our team would love to connect with you, answer any questions, and help you discover your next steps at Spirit of Life.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I wear?
There's no dress code at Spirit of Life. Some people dress casually in jeans and t-shirts, while others prefer more formal attire. Come as you are!

### What about my kids?
We offer exciting, age-appropriate environments for children from birth through 5th grade during our Sunday service. Your children will experience fun activities, worship, and Biblical teaching while you enjoy the main service.

### How do I get connected beyond Sunday?
The best way to get connected is through our [Discover Track](/connect/discover), which meets after service on the first Sunday of each month. You can also join a [Connect Group](/connect/groups) or attend our Wednesday night activities.

### What if I'm not sure about Christianity or church?
You're welcome here! Spirit of Life is a place where you can explore faith at your own pace. We create an atmosphere where everyone—regardless of background or belief—can belong before they believe.

### Do I have to participate in everything?
Not at all. You're welcome to participate in as much or as little as you feel comfortable with during your visit.

## Your First Step: The Community

At Spirit of Life, we believe everyone starts in what we call "The Community" stage. This is where you're exploring, observing, and deciding if this church is right for you. We honor wherever you are in your spiritual journey and invite you to take your next step at your own pace.
