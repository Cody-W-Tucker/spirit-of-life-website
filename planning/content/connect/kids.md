# Spirit of Life Kids

At Spirit of Life Church, we believe children are not just the church of tomorrow—they're an important part of the church today! Our children's ministry is built on the prophetic foundation we received when our church began: **"If you take care of My kids, I'll take care of your church."**

We create fun, safe, and engaging environments where children can encounter God's presence, build meaningful relationships, and learn Biblical truths in age-appropriate ways.

## Our Vision for Children

We believe every child can:

- **Encounter** God's presence in a real and personal way
- **Grow** in their understanding of who Jesus is and who they are in Him
- **Release** the gifts God has placed in them, even at a young age

## Age Groups & Programs

### Nursery (Birth through 2 years)

- **Background Checks**: All volunteers undergo thorough background screening
- **Training**: Our team receives regular training in child safety protocols
- **Health Policies**: Clear guidelines for illness to maintain a healthy environment
- **Security Team**: Trained security personnel monitor our facilities during services
