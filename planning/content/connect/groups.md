# Connect Groups

Connect Groups are the heart of our church community—where we grow together, build relationships, and apply God's Word to our daily lives. These small gatherings of people meet both in homes and at church to connect, learn, and support each other.

> "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching." - Hebrews 10:24-25

## Why Join a Connect Group?

### Build Meaningful Relationships

In a Connect Group, you'll develop deeper friendships with others who share your faith journey. These relationships create a support system for both the challenging and celebratory seasons of life.

### Grow in Your Faith

Connect Groups provide a place to ask questions, discuss Scripture, and learn how to apply Biblical principles to everyday situations. They're designed to help you move beyond Sunday services to a daily walk with God.

### Find Accountability and Support

We all need people who encourage us and help us stay committed to our spiritual growth. Connect Groups provide the accountability and support needed for lasting transformation.

### Discover Your Purpose

As you connect with others, you'll gain insights about your unique gifts and how God wants to use you to make a difference in the lives of others.
