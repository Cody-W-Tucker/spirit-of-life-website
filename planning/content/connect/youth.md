# Spirit of Life Youth

Spirit of Life Youth is a dynamic ministry for students in 6th-12th grades. We're passionate about helping teenagers encounter Jesus, build authentic relationships, and discover their God-given purpose.

> Our vision is to develop fully transformed followers of Jesus with a deep passion for the presence of God.

## From the Shallow End to the Deep End

At Spirit of Life Youth, we believe in guiding students from the "shallow end" to the "deep end" of their faith journey. This means:

- Moving from **surface-level faith** to **deep conviction**
- Growing from **spectators** to **active participants**
- Advancing from **consumers** to **contributors**
- Transitioning from **me-focused** to **others-focused**
- Developing from **knowledge** to **application**
