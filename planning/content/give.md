# Giving at Spirit of Life

At Spirit of Life Church, we believe that giving is not just about money—it's an act of worship that reflects our trust in God's provision and our commitment to His mission.

> "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it." - Malachi 3:10

## The Biblical Basis for Giving

At Spirit of Life, we follow these biblical principles of giving:

### Tithe

The tithe (10% of income) belongs to the Lord and is the foundation of our giving. It supports the ongoing ministry of the local church.

> "A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD." - Leviticus 27:30

### Offerings

Offerings are given above and beyond the tithe as God leads and enables. These gifts help support special projects, missions, and outreach initiatives.

### Generosity

We believe in growing as generous givers, reflecting the generous heart of our God who gave His Son for us.

> "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." - 2 Corinthians 9:7

## Current Giving Projects

### Missions & Outreach

### Next Generation

## Financial Stewardship

We are committed to financial integrity and transparency. The church's finances are overseen by our Finance Team and Board, with regular financial reviews to ensure proper stewardship of all resources.

Annual financial reports are available to church members upon request.
