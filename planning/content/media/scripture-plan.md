# Scripture Reading Plan

Reading God's Word daily is one of the most transformative spiritual disciplines. Our Scripture Reading Plan helps you engage with the Bible in a consistent, meaningful way alongside our church family.

## Current Reading Plan: The Gospel of John

For the next 21 days, we're reading through the Gospel of John together as a church family. This powerful account of Jesus' life will help us encounter Him in fresh ways.
